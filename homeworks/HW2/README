ABSTRACT

`forest' is a pgf/tikz-based package for drawing linguistic (and other
kinds of) trees. Its main features are:
- a packing algorithm which can produce very compact trees;
- a user-friendly interface consisting of the familiar bracket
encoding of trees plus the key--value interface to option-setting;
- many tree-formatting options, with control over option values of
individual nodes and mechanisms for their manipulation;
- a powerful mechanism for traversing the tree;
- the possibility to decorate the tree using the full power of pgf/tikz;
- an externalization mechanism sensitive to code-changes.
